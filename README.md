# EzzMart App - an Ecommerce Application🛒

I developed a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project showcases a dynamic and responsive user interface created with React, a robust back-end API built with Express and Node.js, and data management using MongoDB.

## Special Features:
**1. User Authentication** :- Secure user registration and login with hashed passwords.

**2. Admin and User Dashboards** :- Separate dashboards for admin and users to manage their respective functionalities.

**3. Product Management** :- CRUD operations for products, including creating, updating, and deleting products.

**4. Category Filtering** :- Advanced filtering options by category and price to enhance user experience.

**5. Cart and Checkout** :- A fully functional shopping cart with payment gateway integration.

**6. SEO Optimization** :- Implemented SEO best practices to improve search engine rankings.

**7. Public and Private Routes** :- Protected routes for sensitive operations ensuring secure access control.

**8. Order Management** :- Comprehensive order management system for users and admin to track and manage orders.

**9. Responsive Design** :- Fully responsive design to provide an optimal viewing experience across all devices.

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in the MERN stack but also highlights my ability to create feature-rich, user-friendly, and scalable web applications.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
